# 🔱 Trinetra IDS

Trinetra IDS is a modular Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to capture, analyze, and inspect network traffic in real time. Built with extensibility in mind, Trinetra provides a foundation for protocol analysis, threat detection, alert generation, and future AI-assisted security analytics.

Inspired by **Trinetra (The Three Eyes)**, the project aims to observe network activity, detect suspicious behavior, and provide actionable security visibility.
